# User templates
User templates are used to create a standard set of settings which can then be used to create user accounts through auto provisioning or when users are manually created. An example of using an identity provider would be to use Active Directory Services to authenticate with Hornbill. When this authentication happens, if a user account does not exist in Hornbill it will be automatically created using this template.
