# Logon History
The logon history provides an audit trail of each time there is a user logon to your Hornbill.  This can be a useful tool to identify logon attempts from unknown sources.

* **Filter by account**. The list can be filtered by individual user by typing in a user ID.
* **Filter by account type**. Select from user accounts, basic accounts, and contacts.
* **Show unsuccessful logins only**. This is a particularly useful filter as unsuccessful logins can highlight either an unauthorized attempt to gain access or a user who is struggling to logon.

Each entry includes an expandable section that shows details about the logon.
