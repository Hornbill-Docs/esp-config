# KeySafe
Hornbill KeySafe provides secure encrypted storage for various types of authentication currently only BPM integration nodes make use of these credentials but the KeySafe provides the foundations for secure credential storage for future applications or platform use. Currently any user with sys.c.manageKeysafe system right can view / create / update KeySafe credentials, future iterations will have the notion of sharing credentials so only the creator anyone with shared rights can access them.
