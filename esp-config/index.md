# Platform Configuration
## Introduction
Hornbill Configuration gives access to Hornbill's advanced features and settings. The different areas within Configuration are sensitive to your rights and each user will only see the options for which they have been granted access.

You can access Hornbill Configuration from the main Hornbill App using the URL https://live.hornbill.com/<instance-name>/. To view the Configuration select the cog icon displayed at the bottom of the left hand menu bar, or use Ctrl+Shift+S on your keyboard.
