# Platform Configuration

## Introduction
This document covers how to access and use the Hornbill Platform Configuration.  Platform Configuration gives you access to all the configuration settings for your Hornbill instance. Configure everything from setting up your Organizational structure including the users, departments, and teams that will be using Hornbill and their rights to what they can access down to setting up mailboxes, webhook integration, and the finite system settings. The different areas within Platform Configuration are sensitive to your rights and each user will only see the options for which they have been granted access.

You can access Hornbill Configuration from the main Hornbill App using the URL `https://live.hornbill.com/<your-instance-name>/` . To access Platform Configuration select the cog icon displayed at the bottom of the left hand icon bar, or use **[Ctrl + Shift + S]** on your keyboard.

### Using Search from the Keyboard
You can access the Configuration Search from anywhere within Hornbill using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+S. Once you have entered search mode simply start typing and the most relevant search results will be returned as you type. Once you are presented with one or more search results, you can use the Up/Down arrow keys to highlight the search result of interest and press <return> to navigate to that item.
