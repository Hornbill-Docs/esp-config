# Advanced System Settings

The Advanced Settings provides access to all of the available settings within your instance. These offer serveral detailed configuration options to configure your instance just the way that you want it. Some of these settings can also be managed from within other areas of the Administration interface or from the Hornbill Client. Before changing a setting, it is important to understand how the setting is used in order to prevent any disruption on your instance.

## Experimental features
Included with Hornbill are several experimental features. These are features that are currently being looked at as possible future functionality within Hornbill.

It is important to note that by definition, Experimental Features are provided as a way to allow our customers to preview some of the ideas we are experimenting with, these are "experimental' and that means the following: -

* An experimental feature may be either defective or feature incomplete.
* An experimental feature is subject to change at any time, without prior notice.
* An experimental feature may be withdrawn/taken out of service at any time, for any reason and without prior notice.
* You should not make purchasing decisions based on the experimental features for the above reasons.
* An experimental feature should not be relied upon on for production use. You are free to use experimental features in production if there is an option to enable it, but by doing so you are accepting the points herein.
