## Requests
Requests are at the center of the Service Manager application and as time passes more requests will be created.

### Archive Request Attachments
The Request Attachment Archiver utility provides a simple, safe and secure way to extract file attachments from a Hornbill instance. The utility downloads attachments from a Hornbill instance and saves them in a location on a local machine of your choice.

Once downloaded, the attachment will be deleted from the request and will no longer be accessible from your Hornbill instance. The utility does not affect the request in any other way.

### Delete Selected Requests
The Hornbill Clean Utility provides a quick and easy method of removing requests, from a specified Hornbill instance. This utility allows requests to be deleted based on various criteria such as date logged, status, individual request ID, or service. Clearing out test requests periodically is good practice or some organizations may wish to delete requests older than x number of years. The utility will delete the request record, associated timeline and attachments.
