Because requests are at the center of the Service Manager application, as time passes more and more requests are created, impacting your storage.

### Archive request attachments
The Request Attachment Archiver utility provides a simple, safe, and secure way to extract file attachments from a Hornbill instance. The utility downloads attachments from a Hornbill instance and saves them in a location on a local machine of your choice.

Once downloaded, the attachment is deleted from the request and is no longer accessible from your Hornbill instance. The utility does not affect the request in any other way.

### Delete selected requests
The Hornbill Clean Utility provides a quick and easy method of removing requests from a specified Hornbill instance. This utility allows requests to be deleted based on various criteria such as date logged, status, individual request ID, or service. Clearing out test requests periodically is good practice. You also may wish to delete requests older than x number of years. 

The utility deletes the request record, its associated timeline, and its attachments.
