# Customer Portal Custom Domain Name

It is possible to configure your customer portal to be presented to your customers via a custom domain.  You can read more about [configuring a custom domain for your portal](/esp-config/customize/customer-portal/configure-custom-domain) here before making changes to this setting. 

The format you enter here has to be accurate and in the exact same format as shown here 

`https://your.custom.domain.com`

Please ensure what you enter here follows these requirements exactly

- You __MUST__ use only lower-case letters
- The custom domain __MUST__ start with `https://` because only encrypted traffic is allowed
- The domain name part `your.custom.domain.com` __MUST NOT__ include a trailing forward-slash
