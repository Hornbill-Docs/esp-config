# Email Grouping
Email templates can be assigned a grouping up to 3 levels. This grouping can be used to organize your templates and can help with template selection when using certain application features.

When you assign a template to a grouping you can add new group names on the fly. Some application entities may have a fixed group level one list that you cannot alter though you will be able to define levels two and three.

You can also un-assign a template, or set of templates, from a grouping. When doing so if that change results in no templates having that original grouping then the grouping ceases to exist (groups are not managed separately to templates)
