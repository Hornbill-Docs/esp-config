# Select Company When Registering On Customer Portal
Allow contacts to select their company as part of online registration.

- When enabled the customer registration form on the portal will show a company select box.
- The select list is populated with company records that are marked as being visible on the registration page.
- You will need to make the option visible on the company view form so that you can update those companies that you want to show in the list.
- You can do this by designing the company view.
- Find the 'Company Options' field under the 'Extra' panel and enable the 'Is Visible' and 'Show if empty' options.
- Save the form design and then update any company records.
