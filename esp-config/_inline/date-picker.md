# Date and Time Picker Help

The Date and time picker allows you to enter dates and times by typing directly into the field or by selecting a date from the calendar icon. This tool is designed to recognize various formats and natural language to make data entry faster.

## Date formats

The system recognizes several numeric and text-based date formats. You can use any of the following examples as a guide:

* `Mar 25 2022`
* `25/3/2022`
* `25-03-2022`
* `3/25/2022`

### How the system determines dates

The system automatically identifies the month and day based on the numbers you provide. For example, if you type `25/3/2022`, the system recognizes that 25 must be the day because there are only 12 months in a year.

If the date you enter is ambiguous, such as `3/3/2022`, the system refers to your user profile settings to determine the correct order of the day and month.

## Natural language shortcuts

To save time, you can type common words and phrases. The system will convert these into the appropriate date.

* `today`
* `now`
* `tomorrow`
* `yesterday`
* `next week`
* `next year`
* `next Monday`
* `last Monday`
* `previous Monday`

## Time formats

When entering time, you can use a 24-hour clock or a 12-hour clock with AM or PM notations.

* `22:30`
* `10:30pm`
* `10pm`

## Combined date and time entries

If the field requires both a date and a time, you can combine any of the formats mentioned above. You may use the word `at` to separate the date and time for better clarity.

* `today at 22:30`
* `today at 10:30pm`
* `next week at 10:30pm`
* `Mar 25 2022 10pm`
