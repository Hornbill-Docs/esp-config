# Slideshows
Slideshows provide a way of automatically presenting a number of Dashboards one after another, and against definable transitions periods. These dashboards are great for large screen displays within your support center or they can be accessed by individuals via a Web Browser. The Slideshows are located within the Advanced Analytics under each application in the Administration Portal
