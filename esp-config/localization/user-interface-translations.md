# User Interface Translations
## Translations
Hornbill's Translation feature provides the ability to translate individual strings of text into the language of your choice. Many of these strings can be translated directly [in the user interface](/esp-config/localization/translation-mode). In some cases, however, strings must be translated in Configuration.

## Accessing Translations
1. Open [Configuration](/esp-config/getting-started/using-configuration) using [Ctrl+Shift+S] on the keyboard.
1. Type *translations* in the search box, then select **User Interface Translations** from the results.

or
1. Navigate to **Configuration > Platform Configuration > Internationalization > User Interface Translations**.

## Filter
The filters work off of the translation key and the default translation. Type the name of the key or the default translation to narrow down the list of translation strings that match the text you enter.

## Translating
In the Translated column, you can see the translations that relate to the selected language in the Profile toolbar. If a translation has not been provided, the default language of English is shown.

**To enter a translation:**
1. In the Translated column, click on a translation string.
1. In the *Please provide...* box, do one of the following:
    * Type your own translation in the text box and click **Save**.
    * Click **Suggest** to do an automatic translation and click **Save**.

    :::note
    The **Suggest** option only shows if the selected language is different from the language set in your user profile.
