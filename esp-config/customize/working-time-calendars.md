# Working Time Calendars
The Working Time Calendars define the working or operational hours which can then be used by the different Hornbill Apps to determine when users or teams are working.

## Before you begin
* You should be familiar with how to use [Configuration](/esp-config/getting-started/using-configuration).
* You will need the Admin or Super User role to manage all aspects of the working time calenders.
* Limited access can be provided to users by adding one or more of the following rights to a [user created role](/esp-config/organizational-data/roles#user-created-roles).
    * Manage Working Time Calenders
    * Create Working Time Calendar
    * Delete Working Time Calendar
    * Update Working Time Calendar

## Time zone
Hornbill can be used across multiple geographical regions and time zones. Select the time zone that represents where the teams or users who will be using this particular Working Time Calendar are located. This will ensure that the correct times are stored for the activities that they perform.

## Day and hour selection
Using the grid, mouse over the days and the hours while holding down the left mouse button to select or deselect the working times. Each block highlighted in blue represents an active time.

## Holiday exclusions
Add individual days that will be excluded from the Working Time. This is commonly used for holidays but it can also be used for any other non operational days. Both single day events as well as reoccurring events can be set.
