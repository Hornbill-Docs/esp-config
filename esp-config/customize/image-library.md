# Image Library
The Image Library is used to host images that can be used within different areas of Hornbill. For example, the Employee and Customer portals.

## Before you begin
To access the Image Library, you must have one of the following roles.
* Admin role.
* A user created role that contains the system configuration right **manageImageShare**.

## How images are used
A URL is provided with each image that can be used within a number of areas within Hornbill
* Employee Portal
* Customer Portal
* Intelligent Capture
* Email Templates

## Privilege levels
With each image that is uploaded to the library, there is an option providing three privilege levels.
* **Public**<br>Images set with the privilege of Public can be viewed by anyone.  No login to Hornbill is required.  This can be used for images that are displayed on the [Login Screen](/esp-config/customize/login-screen#splash-image) or on emails sent from Hornbill that need to contain images.
* **Guest**<br>This privilege level requires that the user is logged in with a minimum of a guest level.  This can be used for images that you would like to display on the Customer or Employee portals, but do not wish to have publicly accessible. Intelligent capture scripts that are visible to authenticated guests can also contain images that are provided by the library.
* **User**<br>Use this level when access to an image needs to be restricted to only full users.
