# Design the user profile
The user profile is made up of a number of sections, each containing a collection of related fields.  These fields can be customized to your requirements.

## Topics covered
* Accessing the user profile designer
* How to design the user profile
* The different types of sections
* Field properties

## Section access
The user profile is separated into 5 sections with the default names of:  
* Basic Details
* Job Details
* Contact Details
* Interests & Expertize
* Personal Details

The bottom three sections have an option that allows a user to decide if they want this information visible or not to other users.  Each user can select if these sections are public, accessible by followers, or private.

This is important when designing this form as any field that must be displayed to all users needs to be in the top two sections.
