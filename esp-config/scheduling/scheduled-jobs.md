# Scheduled Jobs
The Scheduled Jobs view shows all scheduled jobs in the system.  This can include reports and tasks. From here, an admin can manage, delete, or reassign scheduled jobs to another user.

## Before you begin
* Be familiar with how to use [Configuration](/esp-config/getting-started/using-configuration).
* The Admin or Super User role is required to access the Scheduled Jobs list.

* All scheduled jobs in Hornbill will be listed here.
* View the **Schedule Status** column to identify which are running and which have failed.
* Select one or more scheduled jobs using the check boxes so they can either be deleted or reassigned to another user.

:::note
Adding scheduled jobs is done through the related interfaces.  For example, tasks can be scheduled through the [task details](/esp-user-guide/my-activities/overview#scheduled-activities).
