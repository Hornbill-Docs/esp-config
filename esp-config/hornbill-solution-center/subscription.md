#### Support Passcodes
Support Passcodes have been designed to allow Customers to grant temporary access to their Instance should this be needed for Support to investigate an open issue. A Passcode will be generated against a particular user, allowing the Support Team Member the ability to investigate behavior with the same access level as the user experiencing the issue.
